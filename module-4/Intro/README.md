* ![graph-based slam](URL)  

### Avatars  

Similar to the virtual identity on the internet through profile pictures, avatars represent people and objects in the virtual world. The table below differentiates both types of identities:  

| Virtual Identity on the Internet         | Avatar in Metaverse                |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Visual and Textual                      | Visual                             |
| No Immersion                            | Embodied                           |
| One can own **multiple Virtual Identities** on different platforms | One can have **multiple avatars** in the metaverse, too. |
| Visual identities are **2D representations** | Avatars are **3D representations**      |
| *Eg.:* **Images** that can be edited or re-clicked | Can be **customized** or **augmented**     |

### 1. Mixed Reality (MR)

MR **combines elements of both VR and AR,** allowing virtual and real-world elements to coexist and interact in real-time.

**User Experience:**  
* Users can interact with virtual objects that are integrated into their physical surroundings.
* MR systems are designed to understand and respond to the real-world environment.

**Examples:**  
* Making virtual and physical elements interact dynamically.
* Design and engineering (e.g., visualizing 3D models in a real-world space)
* Collaborative workspaces where users in different physical locations can share a mixed reality space.

### 2. Extended Reality (XR)

![V-R_continuum](URL)  

It is the umbrella term that collectively refers to AR, VR, and MR.

## Immersive Technologies

### 1. Comparison

There are many essential components and supporting technologies required for Immersive Technologies:

1. Virtual Reality (VR)
2. Augmented Reality (AR)
3. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
4. Blockchain
5. 3D Visualization and Reconstruction
6. Edge Computing
7. High-Speed Networking (5G, 6G)
8. Haptics and Tactile Feedback
9. Spatial Audio
10. Eye Tracking and Gaze Control
11. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)
12. Digital Twins
13. Digital Fashion and Avatars
14. Social VR and Collaborative Experiences

These technologies are different from each other and applicable collectively or individually, depending on the application scenario. Here is a discussion of how we categorized several avatars:

We have tried to categorize these different types of Avatars as follows:

#### Demands in the Industrial Metaverse

I have split the possible areas of works and demand for the metaverse into three sub-sections. These are:

1. Government Projects  
2. Indian Startups  
3. Private Companies

**1. Government Projects** (India and abroad)**:**

* Initiative of DRDO for Advancing Defence and Aerospace through Digital Twins Innovations and Applications [[research areas](https://www.drdo.gov.in/aeronautics-research-development/thrust-areas-research-specialist-panels)]  
* Similar to NASA, Digital Twin offers a lot of potential for the Indian space sector in various application areas. Sierra Space Corporation, a US Space engineering company is dedicated to constructing space platforms that enhance the quality of life on Earth with the help of Dream Chaser vehicle, the first-ever winged commercial space plane that will facilitate human habitation and work in space. The vehicle is developed leveraging tools from the Siemens Xcelerator platform’s portfolio of solutions. [[article](https://www.geospatialworld.net/prime/digital-twin-indian-space-economy/)]  
* Indian national geospatial policy aims to create 'digital twins' of the country's major cities and towns by 2035. [[report](https://www.geospatialworld.net/prime/national-geospatial-policy-indian-innovation-2035/)]  
  * Survey of India (SOI) has already created digital twins of Ayodhya, Dharavi, Kochi, and Kanpur. [[article](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/survey-of-india-inks-deal-to-create-digital-twins-of-big-cities/articleshow/105428462.cms)]  
* [India’s CBDC](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1882883), i.e. governed by central bank, is yet another initiative based on the concept of [global CBDC](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/fintech/central-bank-digital-currency/virtual-handbook) which is focused on:
  * Better regulation of monitory policies and finance 
  * Reduce the frauds
  * Increase the competitions among banks


**2. Indian Startups:**  

* [Paninian Aerospace](https://www.paninian.com/airvoxels-digitaltwin), an Indian startup has focused on designing and developing state-of-the-art <u>Aero-Engines or Turbofan Engines to power critical Defence needs,</u> based on the <u>digital twins.</u> 
* The proposed Augmented Digital Twin Engine helps in
  * Continuously improved designing 
  * Engin health monitoring and Preventive Maintenance
  * Engine performance monitoring 
* [Trace Network Labs](https://trace.network/), is another startup having <u>Metaverse for Fashion & Lifestyle</u> providing a <u>highly immersive environment</u> and leveraging <u>Avatars.</u>
* The startup called IKONZ primarily provides solutions for IP owners through the combination of Generative AI, and Blockchain with Meraverse.  


**3. Private Companies:**

* [Esri India](https://www.esri.in/en-in/home), is working towards the digital transformation of giospecial infrastructures of the country that could be a solution for Highly Populated cities/towns. 
* [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/global/en/company/digital-transformation/industrial-metaverse/what-is-the-industrial-metaverse-and-why-should-i-care.html) is working with several research, academic, and industrial projects to promote the scope of the industrial metaverse and develop solutions for the same. A few of these are:
  * Smart cities management
  * Developing effective healthcare machinery and solutions using Digital Twins
  * Smart automation and monitoring in the aviation domain etc..
* [PTC](https://www.ptc.com/en/blogs/corporate/what-is-industrial-metaverse), is also developing the metaverse for special and other remote solutions [[video](https://players.brightcove.net/1532789042001/HknUe20R_default/index.html?videoId=6330152254112)]. 
      - Emphesise the potential of an industrial metaverse in:
      - Industrial efficiency
      - Increased collaboration
      - Reduced environmental impact
      - <u>Connecting and extending the</u> digital thread
  * The idea of **digital thread** is to sync the digital and physical worlds to optimize products, people, processes, and places. [[page](https://www.ptc.com/en/industry-insights/digital-thread)]
  * The company aims to integrate the  CAD, PLM, ALM, IoT, AR and SLM technologies altogether for a dynamic <u>digital transformation</u>. [[page](https://www.ptc.com/en/about)]
